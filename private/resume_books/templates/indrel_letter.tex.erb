UC Berkeley is the home of the Mu chapter of Eta Kappa Nu (HKN), the International Honor Society
for Electrical Engineers and Computer Scientists. The Mu chapter of HKN consists of Electrical Engineering
and Computer Science (EECS) students who are in the top 25\% of their junior class or the top 33\% of their
senior class. Beyond their impressive academic achievements, HKN members are the most qualified
candidates for engineering jobs due to their extensive extracurricular activities, philanthropic endeavors,
and social involvement in their campus community. Most of our members also have research and work
experience in their fields of students of the distinguished UC Berkeley EECS program, one of the top
programs in the country.

The EECS major combines the disciplines of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science into one
comprehensive curriculum that prepares students for a wide variety of technical jobs. Within the EECS
major, each student may choose one of five areas of emphasis, called "Programs." Program I deals
specifically with electronics, covering the range of solid-state electronics, integrated circuits, microwaves,
plasmas, and quantum and optical electronics. Program II focuses on circuits and systems, covering linear
and nonlinear electronic circuits, communications systems, control systems, and power generation and
distribution systems. Program III is the Computer Systems option, and it emphasizes computer architecture
and software systems. Program IV is the Computer Science option and it emphasizes graphics and
modeling, artificial intelligence and theory. Program V is the general EECS program and samples the entire
range of topics.

HKN offers a variety of services to the students and staff at Berkeley, including peer advising, free
daily tutoring to students, an archive of examination files in both electronic and hard copies, and
evaluations of classes and professors. HKN also helps with many community service events, such as various
YMCA events, the Berkeley Food and Housing Project, and the Alameda County Food Bank. HKN thanks you
for your support, which allows us to continue to provide these valuable services to the students and staff of
the university as well as the surrounding community.
