  %h1 Course Surveys
  %p
    Course survey data for all undergraduate and graduate level EECS courses are available here.
  %p
    There are hundreds of thousands of pages, so, although most aspects work fine, there may be errors of which we are unaware.  If you spot an error, especially a missing class or professor, or have a suggestion for the site, please email www-coursesurvey@hkn.

  %p
    At HKN, we believe that the data displayed and the <em>way</em> that the data is displayed is:
    <ol>
    <li>An <em>accurate</em> reflection of a course and/or course staff member</li>
    <li><em>Usable</em> and <em>accessible</em> by students in evaluating a course and/or course staff member</li>
    <li><em>Transparent</em> for the general public to understand</li>
    </ol>
  %p
